                <span class="quote">
                    In the late 16th century, the Portuguese and Dutch empires were in competition for trade outside of Europe, mostly in the south Asia subcontinent. After Dutch explorers and traders were able to gain knowledge of trade routes used by the Portuguese empire, the Dutch empire began a series of expeditions towards southeast Asia, especially countries around the Indian Ocean.
                    <br><br>Established in 1602, the Dutch East India Company was a Dutch company created with the goal of dominating trade in the Indian Ocean and surrounding countries. Mostly involved in the trade of spices in the Maluku Islands (located in East Indonesia), the company set up trade ports in many cities include Jayakarta or Batavia (modern day Jakarta).
                    <br><br>Forming in 1800, the Dutch East Indies was a colony located in where is now known as Indonesia and was ruled solely by the Dutch mainly for trade use, until 1942. Throughout this time, the Dutch fought many wars with the locals, including the notable Java War. In 1942, during World War II, most of the colony became occupied under Japanese rule, until 1945, when Indonesia became an independent country.

                This source is an image of a 16th century map of the Indonesian archipelago, made by Portuguese explorers. This is a pre-contact source because the Portuguese contacted the Indonesian people before the Dutch, creating colonies for a short period of time in the 16th century. The flags spiked on the islands show where Portuguese colonies were. The map is lay out quite sporadically, due to limited knowledge of the Indonesian islands at the time, and there are ships throughout the map, illustrating how the colonies were used mainly for trade. Because the Portuguese were the first Europeans to contact the Indonesian islands, they were able to easily set up a few colonies around the islands for trade, earning them resources that they had never seen before, including nutmeg, which drew them towards the Spice Islands (formally known as the Maluku Islands). The Maluku Islands would later prove important in trade with other European nations such as the Dutch, as it provided cloves and nutmeg among other resources for trade with other nations. This source is likely to be reliable because it is sourced from a reputable source (the Miller Atlas, a partial world map made in early 16th century Portugal), which can also be confirmed by the style of the map matching that of other maps from the time.

                This image shows a VOC (Dutch East India Company) ship that has been damaged by fire. Painted by Dutch artist Jan van der Heyden, this source is from before the Dutch East Indies colonies were established, but after the Dutch had contacted the Indonesian islands for trade purposes and established their presence in the Indian ocean. This image shows a ship being repaired, after taking damage from fire. The ship being repaired is quite large, but in proportion to the people, not as large as some ships by other nations at the time. Instead, this ship looks like its designed to carry more resources than people, because of its large hull, which could be used for storing resources received and given during trade. The caption below the image, when translated (roughly by Google Translate), describes how the ship “suddenly caught fire”, and due to a “lack of people and order”, the ship “continued to burn for over an hour and a half”. This shows that at the time, Dutch ships were not well equipped, and had a relatively small crew, when compared to the crew sizes of other nation’s expedition groups, due to no real need for more people. Instead, the ships were designed mostly with trade and efficient transport in mind. This source, being sourced from the Royal Academy of Arts from the UK, is likely to be reputable.

                This source is an oil painting produced by Dutch painter and photographer Nicolass Pieneman, which demonstrates the power that the Dutch had over the Indonesian people at the time. In the image, the Indonesian people can be seen being surrounded by Dutch soldiers and looking up to Prince Diponegoro, wearing basic clothing, looking frail, and not having much. The Dutch, on the other hand, were clad in metal shoulder plates and belts, as well as thick boots, clean white pants, and fancy hats. They stand taller and hold weapons and are capturing the prince (who had fought and lead the war against the Dutch, which leads to his eventual capture and exile), suggesting the greater power that the Dutch soldiers had. This image is important, as the submission of Diponegoro triggered the end of the Java war between the Dutch and Indonesian forces. The Java War, beginning in 1825, was caused by the Dutch attempting to pave a road over Diponegoro’s parents’ tombs. Leading the war were Diponegoro and General De Kock, until the time depicted in this source, where Diponegoro was tricked by a false offer for a ceasefire and captured by the Dutch. This source is likely to be one of the most accurate depictions from the war, as the power that the Dutch had over the Indonesians made it difficult for artifacts to be created by the Indonesians. However, this image is likely biased to paint the Dutch as superior or better than the native people, as the creator of this source was a Dutch painter. Such biases could include not showing the casualties or damages done as part of the war.

                This text source is the opening page of a government report created by Dutch government officials, with the purpose of recording development and progress made in the Dutch East Indie colonies. Despite colonies being formed in the 1800s, the series of government reports that this text is from was started only in 1852. There was likely another form of reports being used before this time that did not get archived to the internet. Being the earliest publication that could be found from the series archived on the website, the text (when translated using Google Translate), seems to be the beginning of a “brief overview of the general situation according to the latest tidings”. The beginning of the text describes the colony’s harvests, which includes prosperity in rice and sugar, but worse coffee harvests. These were all foreign ingredients that the Dutch sought from trade, which was why they began the colonies in the first place. The text proceeds to discuss the political state of the colonies, and that there are “rumors … [of] increasing insecurity in Java, in particular for Europeans”, which may be small scale uprisings, especially after the defeat of Prince Diponegoro in the Java War only a few decades earlier. However, concern is dismissed by the author of the text, who claims that “nowhere have [they] seen such concern”. This source is likely to be reputable, as the source has a credible and realistic background, and also comes from a reputable source (Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies, or abbreviated as KITLV).

                In the photograph above, the Indonesian president at the time, Sukarno can be seen declaring the independence of Indonesia. It is important to note that during World War II, between 1942 and 1945, the Japanese occupied the Dutch East Indies, and therefore, the colonies were temporarily under Japanese rule. This source is significant, as it marks the end of colonial rule from both the Dutch and Japanese. Following other events during World War II that influenced the political state of Japan, the Japanese government decided to support the independence movement in Indonesia. Known as “Proklamasi”, the proclamation of independence took place in the president, Sukarno’s house. When translated to English, the proclamation was read as follows:
<span class="quote"><br>
<br>We the people of Indonesia do hereby declare the independence of Indonesia. Matters concerning the transfer of power and other matters will be executed in an orderly manner and in the shortest possible time.
<br>Djakarta, 17 August 05
<br>In the name of the people of Indonesia
<br>Soekarno/Hatta
</span><br><br><br>Note that in the quote, the date refers to the Japanese Imperial year, 2605 (1945) by the Gregorian calendar, further representing the Japanese influence at the time, which could also be seen by the Japanese soldier on the left of the image. This source, an image produced by Indonesian journalist and photographer, Frans Mendur, is likely to be reliable since the image comes from a reputable source with credible information.
