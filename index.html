                This source is an oil painting produced by Dutch painter and photographer <span class="highlight">Nicolass Pieneman</span>, which demonstrates the power that the Dutch had over the Indonesian people at the time. In the image, the Indonesian people can be seen being surrounded by Dutch soldiers and looking up to <span class="highlight">Prince Diponegoro</span>, wearing basic clothing, looking frail, and not having much. The Dutch, on the other hand, were clad in metal shoulder plates and belts, as well as thick boots, clean white pants, and fancy hats. They stand taller and hold weapons and are capturing the prince (who had fought and lead the war against the Dutch, which leads to his eventual capture and exile), suggesting the greater power that the Dutch soldiers had. This image is important, as the submission of Diponegoro triggered the end of the Java war between the Dutch and Indonesian forces. <span class="highlight">The Java War</span>, beginning in 1825, was caused by the Dutch attempting to pave a road over Diponegoro’s parents’ tombs. Leading the war were Diponegoro and <span class="highlight">General De Kock</span>, until the time depicted in this source, where Diponegoro was tricked by a false offer for a ceasefire and captured by the Dutch. This source is likely to be one of the most accurate depictions from the war, as the power that the Dutch had over the Indonesians made it difficult for artifacts to be created by the Indonesians. However, this image is likely biased to paint the Dutch as superior or better than the native people, as the creator of this source was a Dutch painter. Such biases could include not showing the casualties or damages done as part of the war.

                This text source is the opening page of a government report created by Dutch government officials, with the purpose of recording development and progress made in the Dutch East Indie colonies. Despite colonies being formed in the 1800s, the series of government reports that this text is from was started only in 1852. There was likely another form of reports being used before this time that did not get archived to the internet. Being the earliest publication that could be found from the series archived on the website, the text (when translated using Google Translate), seems to be the beginning of a “brief overview of the general situation according to the latest tidings”. The beginning of the text describes the colony’s harvests, which includes prosperity in rice and sugar, but worse coffee harvests. These were all foreign ingredients that the Dutch sought from trade, which was why they began the colonies in the first place. The text proceeds to discuss the political state of the colonies, and that there are “rumors … [of] increasing insecurity in Java, in particular for Europeans”, which may be small scale uprisings, especially after the defeat of Prince Diponegoro in the Java War only a few decades earlier. However, concern is dismissed by the author of the text, who claims that “nowhere have [they] seen such concern”. This source is likely to be reputable, as the source has a credible and realistic background, and also comes from a reputable source (Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies, or abbreviated as KITLV).
